# MyHolo

A simple idle game made by two Hololive fans. Inspired by MyKirito.

## Building

I won't be providing .exe so you have to build it yourself.

prerequisites (not sure if lower versions work):

1. Node.js 16.13.1

building executables:

1. clone/download this repo
2. run `npm install` to install node packages
3. run `npm run make` to build executable

the game executable and all data will be in `./out/myholo-{your-system}/` folder.

## Features to Add

### TODO's

some unfinshed features

- advancement system
- better info/error logging
- favicon

### yet more TODO's

probably won't be done (~~at least before 1.0~~ probably never :P) bacause of ~~time issue~~ tons of exams to prepare for.

- some more comments/docs?
- main page for the game
- tutorial or some kind of tips inside the game
- notification system

### the '有生之年' series

some future work iff I have LOTS of time for this project cuz any of these requires a full rewrite.

- weak typing is poisonous. maybe rewrite in typescript? (personally really want to do this)
- the frontend is a mess now. maybe switch over to vue.js?
- implement character system in a more organized way
- use MySQL or something similar as database instead of json everywhere

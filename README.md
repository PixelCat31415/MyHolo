# MyHolo

A simple idle game made by two Hololive fans. Inspired by MyKirito.

Still under construction. (probably for a long time since I'm still learning JS on the way :cry:)

## TODO's

some more TODO's

- tidy up `main.js` (it's a big mess now)
- finish `Game.js` i.e. the main game manager
- finish `Player.js`. it's missing some features now
- actually link the frontend and backend via ipc
- favicon

## yet more TODO's

probably won't be done (at least before 1.0) bacause of time issue

- some more comments/docs?
- main page for the game
- tutorial or some kind of tips inside the game
- notification system
- advancement system

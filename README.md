# MyHolo

A simple idle game made by two Hololive fans. Inspired by MyKirito.

Still under construction. (probably for a long time since I'm still learning JS on the way :cry:)

## TODO's

some more TODO's

- better info/error logging
- favicon

## yet more TODO's

probably won't be done (~~at least before 1.0~~ probably never :P) bacause of ~~time issue~~ tons of exams to prepare for.

- some more comments/docs?
- main page for the game
- tutorial or some kind of tips inside the game
- notification system
- advancement system

## the '有生之年' section

some future work iff I have LOTS of time for this project cuz any of these requires a full rewrite.

- weak typing is poisonous. maybe rewrite in typescript? (personally really want to do this)
- the frontend is a mess now. maybe switch over to vue.js?
- implement character system in a more organized way
- use MySQL or something similar as database instead of json everywhere
